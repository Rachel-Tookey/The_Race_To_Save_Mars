# The Race For Mars - A Console App 

## Introduction 

**The Race For Mars** is a basic console app that lets the user add and move rovers around a plateau (representing Mars). 

It currently features one level, the Training Level. This allows the user to add as many as 6 rovers. They must use these rovers to get the charging station to complete the level. 
If all rovers are destroyed as exiting the boundaries of the plateau, the game ends.
